# Fantasy Football Draft Tool

> The tool is WIP <br>
> Not all features describe here may be implemented

This ia an in-person fantasy football draft tool. The tool is not meant to replace a draft board. Instead it will help manage a draft. Today this tool uses Yahoo as the fantasy football host.

The tool will provide a ranking of the remaining players. People can have the option to select player positions to see the highest ranked player in that position. The tool will also have a custom timer to show how much time is left for that pick.
